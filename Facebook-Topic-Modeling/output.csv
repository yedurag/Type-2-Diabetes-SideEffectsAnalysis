"""hi, my mum is on a drug trial for cancer currently but the pills have induced a form of diabetes. she had to start on 2000mg of metformin, which she took 4 x 500mg a day. however, it caused her to have severe vomiting, gastro problems and tiredness. she went in a couple of days ago to tell the doctor and she changed her to metformin er. they seemed to be working ok until tonight, as she has really bad vomiting and stomach issues again. i was wondering if anyone else has similar issues and what helped calm them down? also, when is the best time to take the metformin er, she is currently taking 2 x 1000mg tablets just before bed but i am not sure if it should be taken with food or on an empty stomach. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated at this point, i just want her to feel better. thanks""",post53
