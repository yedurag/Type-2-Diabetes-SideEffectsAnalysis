Avandia causes heart attacks, Actos actually decreases the risk of having one. Januvia is weight neutral, and doesn't control your blood sugar (might as well take Tylenol). Byetta will make you lose weight, but then you have an increased risk of pancreatitis.  Glimipiride, glyburide, glicizide can all lead to your beta cells burning out quicker and hypoglycemia.

Type II diabetes,1,"Initially actos seemed wonderful. Then the weight gain started. I had recently lost 50 lbs and was dismayed to be gaining weight after improving my diet and exercising regularly. I noticed achy muscles and fatigue but attributed it to the weight gain (40lbs in 6 months). with the muscle pain came slight joint pain (ankles/knees some shoulder pain) but recently that has turned severe. It is to the point that just walking is a hardship, exercising is out of the question and getting down on the floor to play with my granddaughter(2) and son(10) is completely out of the question. I have lost coordination sometimes feeling as if I have to actually concentrate on the process of walking as my body won't do it naturally. I am even waking at night in pain. I have an extremely high tolerance for pain and I don't whine about minor aches and pains. My family knows if I am complaining this is something serious. My most recent symptom has been the swelling feet ankles and hands. I have been up 30 mi","I am relatively young and have no desire to walk like an ancient old woman.I want my life back.

My mother, father and brother all take it without the extreme side effects that I have experienced. All have had some weight gain and muscle/joint pain but none to the extreme that walking is a chore and that breathing causes weight gain.  
As for the people who think the weight gain is from twinkies and stuffing my face let me just say that is not the case.  I am eating far better now than I ever have and until the extreme pain was exercising regularly. I am being far more proactive than I was when I lost 50 lbs shortly before starting the actos.

This began causing me severe anxiety, as I felt like I was slowly suffocating to death.  As it got worse I began experiencing panic attacks every time I would try to go to bed, because when I was in a prone position I could not breathe.  It got so bad that I was afraid to have anybody near my face for fear they would take my breath away from me.  It caused my poor wife to think that I didn't find her attractive any more because I wouldn't kiss her.  When I finally fessed up as to what was going on, she went on line and found this website and discovered that all of the things I was experiencing had been experienced by other people who had taken the Actos.

abnormal EKG and some artery blockage. My regulary doctor  took me off Avandament and prescribed Janumet.  Withing a week the swelling went away.

With respect to nausea/vomiting, I have found eating a low carb (i.e., less than 30 carbs per meal) diet works best. I have eaten bacon, eggs and cheese (i.e., high fat) for breakfast many times without any impact, so fat doesn't seem to be a problem for me. However, if I eat more than 30 or so carbs the nausea starts. One key point that I have noticed is to minimize the swings in my high - low glucose readings. All in all, follow a typical Type 2 diabetic diet regime, low carb....and things seem to fall in place.

I have not found any correlation with respect to the extreme sleepiness I get some mornings. I thought it may have been low glucose levels, so I tested and typically am in the 140 - 160 range when it happens. Still trying to figure it out.",M,52,y,4,10 mcg,5/8/2010,BYETTA,EXENATIDE SYNTHETIC,AMYLIN

Have lost appetite, losing weight, bs levels are dropping dramatically.  Just have to get used to side effects.  Very scary at first, as I thought I was having panic/anxiety attacks.

I could smell things that noone else could. Almost like a pregnant woman.  When I first started Byetta in Feb of this year the first two to three weeks were horrible. I talked to my GYN and said to take tums and if needed take Zofran for my stomach. After the medicine got used to my body, the side effects went away and was able to eat an hour prior to a meal, without problems. If you go off your dose for a while, you experience the side effects all over again. That's mainly why I took so long to get back in the groove of things.","Since February of 2010 I have lost 70lbs. I have PCOS and the Byetta helps a lot with my body making too much insulin. And since I have been taking Byetta I noticed I haven't had as much woman problems.

It is 5.7 with the Byetta 10 twice a day and 2 metformin 1000 XR per day.  As my weight went down the metformin was reduced to 500 twice a day. I have went from 236 lbs to 196 lbs (40 pounds lost) at this point.  I had trouble getting my insurance company to ok this for me and was off of it for 4 months...just on metformin...and I was hungry all the time and gained some weight back along with my A1C being 7.4!  Now I am back  on Byetta/metformin and I have energy and feel so much better.  I am a little concerned about the pancreatitis possibility.  Would like more info on that.  I had a grandmother, father, and brother all with diabetes.  Thanks to Byetta for giving diabetics a new lease on life.  Had my eye exam this week and eyes were very healthy, BP is under control.

Diabetes Type 2,2,"Vomiting.  Constant, almost debilitating, nausea even when it did not lead to actual vomiting.  I had to be meticulous with my food intake.  Take the Byetta shot, immediately eat a tiny amount, not to exceed 2 tablespoons.  One hour later eat a small meal. I spent all my time planning around eating.

Once I did start vomiting, it continued intermittently for 30 to   60 minutes often followed by chills and lack of energy which sent me to bed for a nap.

Weight loss.  I loved the weight loss and wish I had been able to continue with the Byetta.  It was a wonderful appetite suppressant as well as making food taste a bit ""off"" so that I could not turn to food for comfort.  Wish I could have continued taking it but I just could not handle feeling sick 20 hours a day.",The subQ shots were painless.  The weightloss led to improved blood pressure levels.

If you feel any nausea, then eat right away instead of waiting. Also, if I take my shot and then I don't eat within an hour, I get to feeling slightly nauseated, so don't wait too long after the shot. This allowed me to get off Actos which made me gain huge amounts of weight and the swelling was horrible. My doctor knew Actos was ""hurting me"" but he said that was the only thing that would help at the time. When Byetta came out he immediately took me off the Actos. What a relief!

I gained a tremendous amount of weight after the assault. However I have read that some researchers think that PCOS and stress, especially great stress like this assault where someone tried to kill me and was not caught and may have been able to come back and find me (prolonging the adrenaline PTSD response and fear)... can trigger more severe symptoms as far as PCOS and Insulin Resistance. If there are any researchers in this area who are pursuing this theory you may contact me about stress and PCO, etc. I discontinued Glucophage after the first trimester in both pregnancies I believe, it has been a while so I have forgotten. I now have re-started taking the medicine in order to handle the PCO symptoms of weight gain, period irreg, hirsutism, acne, insulin resistan",F,46,d,365,500 2X D,7/19/2010,GLUCOPHAGE,Metformin hydrochloride ,Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

Bile is produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and secreted into the intestines in order to absorb fats into the bloodstream. One possible reason for the GI problems is that metformin reduces normal reabsorption of bile from the intestines back into the bloodstream, which causes elevated bile salt concentrations in the colon.(25) Most studies suggest that colonic bile salts cause free radical damage to DNA and may contribute to colon cancer. In addition, bile acids may stimulate cells in the colon to produce leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a highly inflammatory substance. LTB4 would be a contributor to any intestinal inflammatory condition.(28) Byproducts of bacterial action on bile salts may lead to intestinal cell damage and absorption of ""foreign"" molecules such as food or bacteria particles into the bloodsteam, possibly causing allergies and other immune responses.

When I was trying to get pregnant, I stopped taking birth control pills and my PCOS symptoms increased dramatically.

I did have have some very uncomfotable symptoms at first, but I slowly increased my dose starting from one pill a day with dinner. The worst symptoms disappeared- UNLESS I WAS EATING UNHEALTHY. One of the ways metformin works is to prevent your body from absorbing all the sugar from starchy food. If you eat food with a high glycemic index, that food doesn't get digested by you- it sits in your GI tract and gets fermented by bacteria. Hence the blaoting and diarrhea. So if you have a lot of symptoms while taking metformin, it may be due to eating the food that is contributing to your condition to begin with.",F,33,m,6,,12/2/2009,GLUCOPHAGE,Metformin hydrochloride ,Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

Type 2 Diabetes,5,During the first month I experienced symptoms similar to flu or sinus allergy...was aware of this side effect beforehand and took an antihistamine to help tone down the symptoms until the side effects wore off after 1 month.  After the first month no major problems.,"I switched to Januvia last year due to too many problems with the side effects of the Actos diabetic drug that I was on before-weight gain, carb cravings, myopathy, etc.  I had taken Actos for over 18 mths and despite different types of strict exercise and diet routines the weight gain piled on and I felt like I was losing muscle strength on top of it.  So I did some online research to find another diabetic med and narrowed it down to Januvia and Byetta-I chose Januvia because I didn't want to deal with the injection routine of Byetta.  I knew about the side effects that some people had with Januvia before I took it, so I took an antihistamine the first month for the flu like symptoms and added extra CoQ10 (conenzyme 10, a necessary enzyme for energy production) for the myopathy like symptoms to my diet.  Since the first month I haven't had any problems and Januvia helps to keep my blood sugar in better control, suppresses the carb cravings and I got my muscle strength back.  Maybe for some of you adding CoQ10 may help you to stay on Januvia-please discuss it with your MD and research this important supplement.

Audience: Diabetes healthcare professionals, patients

[Posted 09/25/2009] FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of revisions to the prescribing information for Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin) to include information on reported cases of acute pancreatitis in patients using these products. Eighty-eight post-marketing cases of acute pancreatitis, including two cases of hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis in patients using sitagliptin, were reported to the Agency between October 2006 and February 2009. It is recommended that healthcare professionals monitor patients carefully for the development of pancreatitis after initiation or dose increases of sitagliptin or sitagliptin/metformin. Sitagliptin has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Therefore, it is not known whether these patients are at an increased risk for developing pancreatitis and the medication should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Considerations for healthcare professionals, information for patients, and a Data Summary are provided.

I attribute any weight loss to eating a proper caloric deficit, which I was already doing before the medication.

About 6 weeks in I started to experience the foul burps, then within 3 days I was constantly nauseous, vomiting, cramping, and still constipated. None of my food was getting processed.

In the recovery phase from removing the Lap Band, the symptoms intensified greatly. Food made me very nauseated, and I could hardly make it through a day at work.  Then I ran out of the needles for injecting Victoza, and the next day I was much better.  Got needles, took Victoza and the following day I was back to feeling rotten.  So I stayed off the Victoza over the weekend, again felt much better.  Saw MD, switched to another antidiabetic medication and have had no further symptoms!","Victoza, along with Metformin and diet, exercise, did help keep my HbA1c lower, and I was blaming the nausea and often vomiting on the lap band.  I did lose some weight while taking the Victoza, but at the cost of being completely miserable most of the time.  I wonder if I would have needed to have the lap band removed had I discovered this adverse effect of the Victoza sooner?  I guess I will never know.  I would like to emphasize that for me, the nausea and fatigue were not just annoying, they were life altering.  The side effects were often debilitating, and once I stopped taking the Victoza, the relief was amazing.  I realize that the company might say that it was the Lap Band causing the side effects, and that is what I thought, and why I had it removed.

Side effects are much less if a person is active and eats less.,"This is a very effective and very strong diabetic medicine which is over-prescribed and causes most of the bad side effects because of too high a dose. I was very cautious in adding it, and through raising 1 click a week and checking bs 3 times a day and logging it found that 1.0mg 1x day brought my blood sugar under complete control with 2000mg of metformin which I intend to continue to take for insulin resistance. It allowed me to completely drop the 6mg of Glimeperide and while bringing my a1c from 7.8 to 6.2 after 15 years of being diabetic. I lost 23 lbs, and changed my eating habits to conform with the Victoza and have kept it off. Those who claim they have put it back on do not realize the appetite loss goes away and you have to monitor your food intake closely as well as exercise. This is not a miracle drug which will work for you if you lay on the couch and eat. That will create the side effects.",M,64,m,4,1.0mg,12/2/2014,VICTOZA,LIRAGLUTIDE RECOMBINANT,NOVO NORDISK INC

Doctor raised dosage to 1.8 ML now have intestinal issues, BGL not much better and feel weak and tired all the time.","For the money this drug does not improve my diabetic life to a point a feel its worth the side effects, risks and improvement in A1C levels.

PCOS,4,"Vomiting, nausea, extreme headaches","Although it is the first drug that has helped me be able to lose weight, the side effects are awful.

Just rough side effects.",F,23,m,2,1.8,1/20/2012,VICTOZA,LIRAGLUTIDE RECOMBINANT,NOVO NORDISK INC
Lower blood sugar,5,"When you first start there is some nausea.  I did vomit a few times, but I guess that probably depends on your tolerance for nausea.   That is the only bad effects I have.","This drug has been wonderful.  I started taking it because even on Metformin my A1c was 9.2, fastings in the high 200s.  It was horrible, bad foot neuropathy etc.  There is some nausea when you first start taking this and I had it fairly bad for the first month probably, but there are things I learned to decrease it.  Smaller meals and I take the shot later in the day like a few hours after lunch.  The worst nausea occurred when I took it right after a meal...Don't do that!!!  It slows stomach emptying and if you take it right after your meal just sits there and causes issues.  I am over 350 pounds and in 3 months I've lost 35 pounds effortlessly. My A1c went from 9.2 to 6.5 in the first three months. I have been huge my whole life.  I have always felt like I was missing something that tells me when to stop eating....Victoza does that for me.  Now I will have a meal and eating along as normal and something will just tell me its enough and I stop with no problem.  I very rarely finish my plate now.  I have a stop button now and I stay full longer.  I no longer eat anything after dinner...no interest in it at all.  I also do not crave carbs like I use to.  Yes the side effects can be bad at first, but I can say with all honesty that now 4 months out and I do not have any side effects, but maybe rarely.  If you are big and your sugars are out of wack the side effects are worth it.  Just get through the first 2-4 weeks and be smart, don't stuff yourself especially at dinner.
